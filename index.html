			<p>

				Git (/ɡɪt/[8]) is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software 

			</p>
			<p>
				Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[13] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[14]
