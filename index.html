				Git (/ɡɪt/[8]) is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development,[9] but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed,[10] data integrity,[11] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[12]

			<p>
				Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[13] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.

			As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[14]
